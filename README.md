### CBDC Overview
The popularity of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin [1], Ethereum [2], XRP [3], etc., is gaining attention and speeding up their circulation worldwide. These cryptocurrencies are not regulated by any centralized authority (i.e., government) also not considered as legal tender, which could lead to the support for anti-money laundering (AML), financing of terrorism (CFT), and other criminal activities. In particular, several countries are afraid of these illegal cryptocurrency circulations and planning to implement their legal digital money called central bank digital currency (CBDC). The CBDC uses digital tokens generated by converting any nation’s fiat/stable currency into digital tokens using distributed ledger technology (DLT) [4]. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, these digital tokens are generated by the nation’s monetary authority and issued and regulated under the central bank’s governance. Therefore, these digital tokens are pegged by a suitable amount of monetary assets such as gold or foreign currency reserves. The adoption of DLT in CBDC improves the current financial infrastructure by building trust in the issuance and circulation of digital tokens.

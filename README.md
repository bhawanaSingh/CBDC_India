###### CBDC Overview
The popularity of cryptocurrencies such as **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **XRP**, etc., is gaining attention and speeding up their circulation worldwide. These cryptocurrencies are not regulated by any centralized authority (i.e., government) also not considered as legal tender, which could lead to the support for anti-money laundering (AML), financing of terrorism (CFT), and other criminal activities. In particular, several countries are afraid of these illegal cryptocurrency circulations and planning to implement their legal digital money called **central bank digital currency (CBDC)**. The CBDC uses digital tokens generated by converting any nation’s fiat/stable currency into digital tokens using **distributed ledger technology (DLT)**. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, these digital tokens are generated by the nation’s monetary authority and issued and regulated under the central bank’s governance. Therefore, these digital tokens are pegged by a suitable amount of monetary assets such as gold or foreign currency reserves. The adoption of DLT in CBDC improves the current financial infrastructure by building trust in the issuance and circulation of digital tokens. 
#### Wholesale and Retail CBDC
***Wholesale CBDC*** 
> The wholesale CBDC is for the authorized financial institutions that carry reserve deposits with the central bank. A wholesale CBDC is issued, distributed, managed, and stored entirely by the central bank or by an authorized institution appointed by the central bank to perform such tasks. The entities involved in the wholesale CBDC are not anonymous because they pre-register themselves under the central bank to access and conduct interbank payment settlement transactions processed by the central bank or through the authorized institution. The benefit of bringing wholesale CBDC in place of the traditional wholesale market is enhancing security and payment settlement efficiency, enabling real-time monitoring, minimizing counterparty credits and liquidity risk. 
> On the other side, the retail CBDC is issued for the general public to purchase goods and services and send/receive digital tokens for fulfilling their routine demands [7]. The idea of retail CBDC is to promote a cashless society to reduce cash printing costs and make payments outside of the banking system, similar to cash payment [8].
